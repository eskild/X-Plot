#           X-PLOT/WINPLOT VERSION 1.0 LIBRARY FILE
#
# This file is a library of functions and constants for use
# with X-Plot version 1.x.
# Please note the following points:
#
# 1. Lines, such as these, starting with a '#' are comments.
# 2. Empty lines are allowed.
# 3. An expression must not span more than one line.
# 4. Two types of expressions are allowed: Constant and
#    formula expressions.
# 5. Forward references are not allowed, ie. don't use a
#    constant or function before you've declared it.
#    Note! Is is possible to violate this rule by loading
#    the same file after having made modifications. This,
#    however, is only a feaure of version 1.x and will thus
#    disappear in the future.
# 6. Constants can't use function expressions, ie.
#      a = sin(0.33)
#    is illegal.
# 7. Operators and symbols available are (normal precedence applies):
#	^	exponent	z^2
#	( )	paranthesis	(z*(1+i)+3)/4
#	*	multiply	z*2
#	/	divide		z/2
#	+	add		z+i
#	-	subtract	z-i
# 8. Predefined functions:
#	Arg		argument
#	acos	*	arcus cosinus
#	asin	*	arcus sinus
#	atan	*	arcus tangens
#	conj		complex conjugate
#	cos		cosine
#	cosh		hyp. cosine
#	exp		e^z
#	im		imaginary part
#	log		natural log
#	log10	*	base 10 log
#	norm		norm
#	random		pseudo-random value between 0 and 1.
#	re		real part
#	sin		sine
#	sinh		hyp. sine
#	sqrt		square root
#	tan	*	tangens
#	tanh	*	hyp. tangens
#    Functions marked with '*' are only available in WinPlot.
# 9. Predefined constants:
#	e	(2.7182..., 0)
#	i	(0, 1)
#	pi	(3.1415..., 0)
