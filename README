           X-Plot  --  a program for visualizing complex functions


                 Copyright (C) 1996-2011 Martin Eskildsen


==============================================================================

This repository contains X-Plot, an interactive visualization program for
complex algebra. The program is quite old, circa 1995-1996 and was written in C++
for the Motif X toolkit. I've ported it to an up-to-date Linux distribution and
published the sources and build instructions for Ubuntu 11.04.

While quite dated, I still believe the software is interesting and -- given the
proper formula and input object -- capable of producing beautiful output.

The program was developed for the "Analyse 4" course taught at the Technical
University of Denmark as part of the required curriculum for the M.Sc. degree.

The code, as it stands today, compiles and runs on Ubuntu 11.04 and seems
reasonably stable. There's some old cruft left around today that some simple
code refactoring can remove. If I get the time, I will. This version is simply
the "Lets Get The Code Out" release -- if I don't do it now, I may never get
around to it again...   :-)

    Technical University of Denmark.



NO SUPPORT
----------
This piece of software was produced during a number of courses at the
Technical University of Denmark; as these courses have ended, the
author can NOT SUPPORT this program except on a best-effort basis!
You are mostly on your own.



NO DOCUMENTATION
----------------
Apart from the very scarce comments in the code, there is NO source
code documentation whatsoever. I was in a hurry back then, and that's
the result.



NO UPDATES
----------
Do not expect updates to be produced. I may do some occasionally (a
QT port is under consideration). Still, if you have comments, please
use the above contact address.



FEATURES
--------
Now that these formalia have been noted, here's the feature list:

* X Window based (X11R5/6, Motif 1.2)
* Can generate output for PostScript printers
* User's guide in file "howto.tex"
* Free software! Available via git: git@github.com:eskild/X-Plot.git
* Visualizes complex functions: enter a function, draw a curve, see
  the result.
* User-defined functions and constants.
* Very interactive.
* No integrated handling of function branches. The principal branch is
  always used.
* Singularities are not handled perfectly. If a singularity arises for
  a point, it is mapped to infinity (as close as the computer
  gets). This isn't desirable, but there it is.
* The most messy source you'll ever encounter (hopefully!)



FILES AND DIRECTORIES (of special interest)
-------------------------------------------
* src/*                 - source code
* run/*                 - some files necessary for running X-Plot
* install/*             - where files are put after 'make install'

* src/x.cc              - C++ main() function
* src/xplot             - executable
* run/xplot.default.lib	- default library of functions
* run/xplot.print       - PostScript printer setup file
* doc/howto.tex         - a "user guide" of sorts


PLATFORMS KNOWN TO WORK
-----------------------
* (In the, eh, "good old" days: HP-UX 9 and 10; Digital Tru64 Unix on Alpha.)
* Ubuntu 11.04.

For Ubuntu, you'll need a full C++ and X11 development environment, and
Open Motif as well. For building the documentation you'll need LaTeX.

It may be possible to get LessTif to work; I tried it years ago, and it was
almost, but not entirely, functional.

Once upon a time the program also ran on Windows 3.1 and was called WinPlot,
but I mislaid the relevant source files years ago, so that version is now
lost. It also explains why the UI parts of the code may look overly
abstracted -- there actually used to be two UI targets.


COMPILER
--------
(Back then: Gnu C++ 2.7.2. And Borland C++ 3 on Windows, if my memory serves
me.)

* Ubuntu: GNU C++ 4.5.



BUILDING
--------
In addition to the usual C++ and X11 development files, you may need this:

* sudo apt-get install libmotif-dev libxt-dev libxext-dev x11proto-print-dev

Then, in the simple case, just run make, perhaps even make -j 4 or more if
you have a few cores hanging idly around.

Other make targets of interest:

* install - copy files to install directory
* clean   - clean .o files and such



RUNNING
-------
* make install && cd install && ./xplot &

You now get four windows: A main window, a coordinates window, a domain
window and a range window. Try this:

* Focus main window, right-click the empty space below the menu bar (yes,
  really...)
* In the dialog, enter z^2 and click OK
* Now move the cursor in the domain window and see how the z=(x,y) coordinates
  are mapped through z^2 in the range window. The coordinates window shows
  the numerical values of the mapping
* Now left-click in the domain window and draw a circle (you can draw other
  things by first right-clicking in the domain window and choosing the object
  type). The circle is then mapped into the range window.
* Controls:
    - Domain window: Left click: Draw;    right click: config dialog
    - Range window:  Left click: Nothing; right click: config dialog
    - Main window:   Left click: Nothing; right click: config dialog (a pattern
      emerges...)
    - Domain/Range windows: Shift + left/right click: Center the view at the mouse
    - Domain/Range windows: Ctrl  + left/right click: Zoom in/out
* Have fun! And do remember to send me some feedback, good and bad -- but please
  be serious; life's too short for Internet abuse, isn't it?
